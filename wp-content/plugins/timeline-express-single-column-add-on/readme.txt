Enable a 'single-column' parameter in Timeline Express to display timelines in a single column.

== Description ==

Timeline Express - Single Column Add-On extends Timeline Express, and enables a new shortcode parameter `single-column`.

When set to 1 (eg: `[timeline-express single-column="1"]`), the timeline will display in a single column - similar to the default Timeline Express mobile view.

**Basic Usage**

If you want to set a timeline to single column you can add the 'single-column' parameter to the `[timeline-express]` shortcode and set it to `1`.

**Example**
`[timeline-express single-column="1"]`
